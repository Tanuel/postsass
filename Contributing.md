# Contributing to PostSass

If you want to add a feature or Bugfix, please create an [issue](https://github.com/Tanuel/postsass/issues) first

You can then create a Merge Request referencing the issue.
Keep changes simple and don't try to do thousand things at once ;)

## Setup

Fork and clone the repository, then 
* run `yarn install` to set up dependencies
* run `yarn build` to compile typescript files to javascript
* go into the examples directory, run `yarn install`, then `yarn test`

## Commit Guidelines

We currently do not have commit convention enforcements in place, but would prefer
to stick to [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
